## About The App
Finnkino Elokuvainformaatio is an app that uses the live REST API from Finnkino. 
In the app, users can select a theater from a dropdown menu, and the page will display the movies currently playing at that theater. 
Alternatively, users can search for a movie by name in the search field, 
and the page will show the results based on the search term. 
The search can also be performed using both methods simultaneously.

## Screenshots

## Technologies
html, bootstrap, css ja javaScript

## Setup
You can use the application via the link located under the demo link section.

## Status
The project currently meets the requirements of the task, but additional features and improvements could still be made. 
For example, when a user searches for a movie by name in the search field, the movie details could include information about where the movie is playing. 
More information could also be added to the movie details, as the application currently only shows the movie title, start time, and duration in minutes.
